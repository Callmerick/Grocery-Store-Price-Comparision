# Grocery-Store-Price-Comparision
Grocery Store Price Comparison is a web analytics project that aims to gather timely data corresponding to the prices of groceries from major competitorsâ€™ websites and looking at how the prices vary across the spectrum. This tool allows our clients to make informed changes in regard to pricing schemes, marketing efforts, and any other business ideas in order to get as close to their maximum profit margin.

This project requires four of us to crawl grocery store price data from 5 sections and 4 major grocery store websites. In total, we generated 20 notebooks for web crawling, 4 notebooks to create store master file and 1 notebook to create "All Store Master File". We did the data cleaning in each steps as well. We used Selenium and Beautiful Soup as our crawling techniques, Pandas library to do data cleaning and manipulation, and Tableau to create graphs.
