# Grocery-Store-Price-Comparision
Grocery Store Price Comparasion is a web analytics projects that requires four of us to crawl grocery store price data from 5 sections and 4 major grocery store websites. In total, we generated 20 notebooks for web crawling, 4 notebooks to create store master file and 1 notebook to create "All Store Master File". We did the data cleaning in each steps as well. 

We tested the crawling technique and agreed on the data standards for 2 weeks, did web crawling for a month and made deliverables for a week. We started the project early so that we were always ready 3 days before due date. 

If you want to read deliverables, please go to Final Report.pdf and presentation slides.pdf. You can even see our presentation by opening up the Presentation Video.mp4 file! Hope you enjoy it!
